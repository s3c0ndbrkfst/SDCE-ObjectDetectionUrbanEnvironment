## Project Submission Writeup

### Project overview
This project uses data from the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/) to train an object detection model and explore different training methods that are available to create an effective model. MORE

### Set up
The [README](./README.md) contains detailed steps to set up and train a model. Below is a brief summary of the process.

### Dataset
#### Dataset analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a very important process and should be the first step taken when training a new model. Sample output images generated by the process are shown below. Given the below sample of 10 images, there are 6 taken in clear daylight, 2 including weather events, 1 taken around dusk and 1 taken at night. From this, it is likely that the entire dataset follows a similar distribution in which a majority of the images show clear daylight conditions, with a smaller majority including factors such as weather and low lighting. Knowing this, it will be key to include data augmentations that can simulate more factors to improve the models performance in all conditions and lighting instead of being focuses on perfect conditions only.

Additional data analysis was performed to better understand the distribution of classes throughout the images of the dataset. For a 1000 image batch of the dataset, the distribution by class follows the below chart. In this 1000 image set, the counts for each class are 17723 vehicles, 5191 pedestrians, 143 cyclists. Understanding the distribution can allow for more precise tuning of the model. For example, if there are few cyclists compared to pedestrians, it would be important to choose tuning parameters and other model factors that are able to train the model appropriately given the small number of relative instances of the cyclist class in the dataset.

#### Cross validation
The data supplied in the project workspace is already split appropriately following a ADD split. MORE

### Training
#### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

#### Improve on the reference
The initial training did not perform well so several experiments were performed to improve on this including adding data augmentations and updating the optimizer. The following table outlines the three experiments and a summary of the changes tested.

| Experiment           | Tested Changes |
| :------------------: | :-----------: |
| 1 - Augmentations    | Added data augmentations |
| 2 - Learning Rate    | Updated learning rate of base model |
| 3 - Optimizer        | Changed optimzer to Adam and implemented manual step learning rate |
